# .lck files - KiCad creates a .lck (lock) file when you open a schematic that prevents anyone else from opening it up unless the file is deleted
# It is usually deleted when you close the schematic, but it you stage and commit while the schematic is still open then you end up commiting the file
# p.s. I tested this on a new local branch first and everything was fine
