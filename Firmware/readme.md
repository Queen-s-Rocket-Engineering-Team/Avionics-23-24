# Firmware: Spaceport America Cup 2024

This directory contains the SRAD firmware flown at the Spaceport America Cup 2024 competition. Though mostly functional, it contains a few known problems and is not feature-complete. Much of the codebase was developed in a very short time period by some very talented individuals (thanks Brent & Tristan!).
