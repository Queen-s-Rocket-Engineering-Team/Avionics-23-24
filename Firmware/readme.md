# Firmware: Launch Canada 2024

This branch contains the SRAD firmware for the Launch Canada 2024 competition. The code has been forked from the Spaceport 2024 branch.


SPACEPORT DISCLAIMER: Currently, though mostly functional, this branch contains a few known problems and is not feature-complete. Much of the codebase was developed in a very short time period by some very talented individuals (thanks Brent & Tristan!).
